In JavaScript, single quotes('') and double quotes("") are interchangeable. With ES6, we now even have backticks(``) for template literals. When you want to write a quick script to find all the strings without introducing a heavy parser, you may think about using RegExp. For example, you can have:

```ts
/['"`](.*?)['"`]/g
```

It works for most of the case, but not for mixed quotes:

```ts
'const a = "Hi, I\'m Anthony"'.match(/['"`](.*)['"`]/)[1] // "Hi, I"
```

You have to make sure the starting quote and ending quote are the same type. Initially I thought it was impossible to do it in RegExp, or we have to do like this:

```ts
/'(.*?)'|"(.*?)"|`(.*?)`/g
```

That's definitely a bad idea as it makes you duplicated your notations. Until I found this solution:

```ts
/(['"`])(.*?)\1/g
```

`\1` is a [Backreferences](https://www.regular-expressions.info/backref.html) to your first group, similarly you can have `\2` for the second group 2 and `\3` for the third, you got the idea. This is exactly what I need! Take it a bit further, to exclude the backslash escaping, now we can have a much reliable RegExp for extracting quoted texts from any code.

```ts
/(["'`])((?:\\\1|(?:(?!\1)|\n|\r).)*?)\1/g
```
