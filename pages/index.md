Hey, I am Anthony Fu, a fanatical open sourceror.

Being part of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) core team, I am maintaining [@vue/composition-api](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api), a plugin providing Composition API to Vue 2. I am interested in [Vite](http://vitejs.dev/) a lot. I made several Vite plugins and an opinionated starter template [Vitesse](https://github.com/antfu/vitesse), which is also what this site is based upon. You may also know me as a member of [wenyan-lang 文言](https://wy-lang.org/), a programming language for the ancient Chinese. I helped building the [VS Code Extension](https://github.com/antfu/wenyan-lang-vscode) and it's [Online IDE](https://ide.wy-lang.org/).

Dreaming up ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies. Check out my [full projects list here](https://antfu.me/projects).

I have also started a 100 day challenge about design, compform, interactivity and experimenting new things on [100.antfu.me](https://100.antfu.me/). Updates on [twitter](https://twitter.com/antfu7/status/1325977074813739009).

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing photography and traveling. Some of my photos can be found on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/antfu7). If you happended to be in the same city I live (currently in Taipei), maybe we can hang out and take some photos together.
