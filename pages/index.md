Hey, I am Anthony Fu, a fanatical open sourceror. Working at [NuxtLabs](https://nuxtlabs.com/).

Creator of [Vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest), [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev), [VueUse](https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse), [UnoCSS](https://github.com/antfu/unocss), [Type Challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges) and [others](/projects).<br>
Core team member of [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Nuxt](http://nuxtjs.org/) and [Vite](http://vitejs.dev/).<br>
Team member of [Windi CSS](https://windicss.org/), [wenyan-lang 文言](https://wy-lang.org/) and [Intlify](https://github.com/intlify).

Dreaming up ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies. You can find my [full projects list here](/projects). I have also started a 100-day challenge about design, compform, interactivity, and experimenting with new things on [100.antfu.me](https://100.antfu.me/).

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing photography and traveling. Some of my photos can be found on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/antfu7). If you happen to be in the same city I live (currently in Xiamen), maybe we can hang out and take some photos or code together.
